            The world has known about the swords since the first civilisation to the present time.
            It holds a special place in the development of human civilisation, as they represent might,
            bravery,chivalry,destruction,etc and has some great importance in many legends.
            There are many great legends associated with swords like the holy excalibur of Britain, 
            Zeus’s adamantine sword with which Perseus slayed Medusa.

            Origin and evolution of sword
        </font>
        <p style="font-family:georgia;margin-left: 20%;margin-right: 20%;color:midnightblue;">
            The early swords developed from the evolution of the dagger, a knife with two cutting surfaces. 
            Unlike a traditional blade, daggers provide an increased ability to inflict damage as you can 
            attack with both sides of the weapon singly or simultaneously.<br>
            <br>
            Due to the lack of suitable resources the early swords were impractical to use, 
            until the early Bronze Age(around 3000 bc). But still they were only longer draggers, 
            since bronze(an alloy of copper and tin) still had its disadvantages.<br>
            <br>
            Bronze has low stiffness, which makes this long dagger-like swords bent with minimum impact.<br>
            <br>
            The first weapons which could be classified as a sword began to appear from the Iron Ages, 
            without any problems. These swords gave the way for Roman Spatha, the predecessor of many of 
            the European middle ages swords.<br>
            <br>
            During the Middle Ages, swords morphed into the classical arming sword with crossguard 
            that is the template for many modern swords.<br>

            Different Types of Swords
        </font>
        <p style="font-family:georgia;margin-left: 20%;margin-right: 20%;color:midnightblue;">
            Any attempt to classify swords into various set types is sure to encounter nomenclatural problems.<br>
            <br>
            First, hundreds of sword types exist from different eras of human history and various locations around the world. 
            Consequently, there was no universal consensus on specific types of swords.
            As a result, historical terms like broadsword and longsword were often used to label weapons of similar appearance but of different historical periods, 
            regional cultures, and fabrication technology. These terminologies also usually did not pay regard to their intended use and fighting style.<br>
            <br>
            Secondly, in most historical cultures, a sword was called “sword” in their native language without regard for its specific features.<br>
            <br>
            Although the English language terminology used in the classification of swords is imprecise, 
            it is no doubt a great way to understand the types of swords. While the classification scheme has varied widely over time, 
            it has always grouped swords by blade type or by hilt type.<br>
